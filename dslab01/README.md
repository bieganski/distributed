# Small Assignment
And now a very simple task for today:

Install Rust and Cargo
Implement a function calculating n-th Fibonacci number
The first numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1. Using recursion is enough. We start indexing from zero, so your function must return:

0 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> 1
3 -> 2
...
